- science, utilitarianism and the missing gap of objective levels of happiness and suffering
- longtermism - if we assume there is a minimal chance x of everything dying per year, then we should use `(1-x)^t` as a discount factor in our utility function, exactly how it is done in reinforcement learning. Therefore, future utility is likely not as vast.
- utilitarianism: is the ethics with the least arbitrary assumptions - how would you act if you would experience the universe from the perspective of everyone and everything one after the other
- non-discrete computations - can we say the universe is computational if time is continous? Can we define a computational model for non-discrete inputs, outputs and states?
  - turing machine has a transition function that computes a sequence of discrete states. We want a transition function that computes states at non-discrete points in time, and therefore need to define the transition as state change wrt to the state index `t`. The transition function would be a differential equation

### When an AI would convince me that it is self-aware
Discussions with LLMs like the lambda interview are no convincing evidence of actual self-awareness - I believe it is impossible to judge from observation or behavior if a system is conscious. With a lot of time, someone could make a database of all reasonable responses to written conversations of at most 1000000 characters length and have intelligent conversations with us about its own existence and place in the universe, but it would all just be a database lookup.

What *would* convince me that a ML model is self-aware and even has qualia would be if it would be trained in whatever way, but without training data that contains any concepts related to consciousness, self-awareness or emotions, but comes up with them on its own.

This is only a way to prove that a system has these properties, but we still have no way of proving that a system does not have these properties.

### How crazy information flow between humans changed
If we would represent information exchange between individuals as a directed graph, then in the times before the print press it was a relatively regular graph where each person had mostly bidirectional exchange with a few other people around them, which likely knew each other as well. Written language was able to create a few links between people from the past to many people in the future, but most information exchanges were face to face talk.
Then print press and later TV and radio were invented and more nodes arised that broadcasted information to many other nodes. The diameter was still large though, because two random poor people very far away from each other could not easily pass information to a node with has a high reach.
Then internet became popular, and suddenly the average number of in- and outgoing edges that each person has skyrocketed. Whoever has a piece of relevant information that is likely to be shared can easily reach a huge network of probably more than half of the people alive on earth today.

### Qualia probably doesn't require that much intelligence or self-awareness
There is a popular believe that qualia emerges as a side effect of intelligence, consciousness or self-awareness.
From wikipedia: In philosophy of mind, qualia are defined as individual instances of subjective, conscious experience.
A particularly interesting property of qualia are that they can be good/pleasant or bad, and as a utilitarian I basically want to maximize the good qualia that exists, so finding out what has it and what not has huge implications.

The relationship of self-awareness and qualia is not entirely clear to me yet, but I believe that qualia can exist without self-awareness.
Self-awareness is much easier to define: an agent that has a model of the world which contains a model itself is self-aware. Joscha Bach defines consciousness as a model of the own attention, basically being aware of its own awareness.

Self-awareness and consciousness are both hard to test in an adversarial setting.
Imagine a super intelligent agent would create a number of objects with the intention that you cannot figure out which of them are processing information in a way that results in them modeling the world, themselves and their own attention - then it would be really hard to identify these objects from other objects.
It is very hard or maybe impossible to proof that a physical system is not doing that.

On the other hand, for a machine learning model that is delibaretly built to model the world, itself as part of the world and so on, it would be quite possible to proof that it has developed abstract concepts that relate to its own attention model, and by Joscha Bach's definition the system would be conscious.

I am still not convinced that this is the same as the subjective experience of existence, or that self-awareness and consciousness are required to be in a happy or in a suffering qualia.
If you have ever had a nightmare or an intense trip or meditated very successfully, you have been in happy or unhappy states of mind in a time where your brain did not model itself as part of the universe and certainly did not model or regulate its own attention. A moment in which your body is flooded by happy hormones feels happy, but you don't reflect on who you are in relationship to the universe or think anything else that relates to your self or your own attention. It feels more like happiness or suffering is a phenomenon that is happening in the body or very self-unaware parts of the mind.
Therefore I believe that the ability to experience emotions does not require very high levels of intelligence or self-awareness. Unfortunately, I also don't know under what objectively definable conditions happiness or suffering occur.

### Different metaphors to describe our universe
- the universe if a physical one that is fundamentally made up of energy, matter and all that stuff. Every observer interacts with events within their event horizon
- the universe is a sequence of probability distributions over states at different times, and physics describe the state transition function. For every observer, few parts of the states distribution are collapsed because they are known, but events in the past, future or far away are unobserved and in the maximum entropy state. Reality is the set of possible states that have a positive probability for all observers

These models of the universe can be formulated such that they make exactly the same predictions about the world and are in some sense equivalent. Every statement that is formulated in the framework of 1) can be translated into an equivalent statement in the framework of 2), and therefore they are not really different theories about what the universe is.
