# What are emotions?

In this text, I want to formulate what emotions are from the perspective of an observer that has no emotions itself.
Emotions have a close relationship with consciousness, and similar to the hard problem of consciousness, it is not obvious how to know what another mind feels like, how emotions feel to them. It could be that one person perceives emotions 1000x as strong as another person, but the two different emotional experiences lead to exactly the same behavior. Or, more realistically: it could be that one species perceives emotions on a different intensity than another one.
This creates a challenge for utilitarians: if you want to maximize the happiness of all beings in the universe, you need a way of comparing happiness between beings.

So, how can we approach this question? We can start by trying to describe emotions as good as possible in terms of observable properties.
1. An obersvable property of consciousness is that humans discuss consciousness, and the same is true for emotions. More specifically, we often talk about how to change or process emotions, because this is something we want and because by consciouss thoughts, we can affect our emotions.
2. Emotions occur in animals (humans) that likely evolved through evolution. It is therefore likely that emotions had a positive effect on the reproductive fitness of some animals.
3. Emotions affect the behaviour and thinking of the mind that experiences them. Concrete examples are:
    - effect on the overall activity: tired, sad, peaceful feelings cause the experiencer to be less active, while awake, stressed, excited feelings cause the experiencer to be more active
    - effect on the interpretation of others: angry, grumpy feelings cause the experiencer to assess others as more evil. Happy feelings cause the experiencer to assess others as more good.
    - effect on short term goals: feeling hungry causes that experiencer wants to eat, sleepy that they want to sleep, horny that they want to have sex, etc
4. Emotions are closest to what we are optimizing for
    - we want to be happy, excited, feel love etc and avoid feeling pain, boredom, humiliation etc
    - other goals are usually instrumental to experiencing these feelings

At the moment, this is all that comes to my mind and not enough to answer the opening question.
