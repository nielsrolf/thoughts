# If the universe is computational, can a movie be sentient?

If we assume that consciousness is computational (which is implied if we believe that the universe is computational), we believe that there exists a function that, if computed, produces a subjective feeling of existing.

Let's define the state of a computer that computes this function at time `t` as `s(t)`.

What happens if we cache all the operations and just save `s(t)` for all `t`? We ask the computer repeatedly what will happen at time `t=1000000s`.
In order to compute it just loads all the state `s(t)` from the cache into memory like a movie that is being played, but also still computing the same function.
Will this replay of a cached computation generate a subjective feeling of existing in the same way as our feeling of existing? What happens if only a few time steps are cached, and the intermediate steps are calculated?

I am not entirely sure about the implications that a continous time has on this.
Our digital computers could neither simulate nor cache a trajectory of a universe with continous time, but I'd guess other physical processes can be used to build a continous time computer (the obvious one being the complete system itself as a computation of its own state at time `t`).
However, I cannot imagine how you can transform the state/memory of the computer in continous time without there being the same causal process, so I have a feeling that replaying a cached memory of a cintous time computation would boil down to actually doing the computation again, but I'm not sure.
