# entropy
- information theoretic definition
    - discrete
    - continuous
- physics definition
- relationship physics and IT
- is the universe discrete, is it reversible?
    - continuous, reversible: works out i think
    - discrete, reversible: number of states at T=0 is exactly equal to possible number of states at T=100
- simulations:
    - discrete, naive:
        entropy increases
        it's due to rounding errors, therefore irreversible
    - discrete, analytically:
        ?
        maintains internal state, therefore is fundamentally continuous with a modified entropy function (rasterizing the continuous space before we measure entropy)
    - continuous, reversible:
