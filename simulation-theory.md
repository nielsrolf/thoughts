# How likely is it that we are living in a simulation?

The simulation hypothesis states that there exists a parent universe in which a computer simulates the observable universe.
If this is true, then for every distiguishable state of our universe, there has to be at least one distinguishable state of the parent universe, because one state of the computer can at most represent one state of our universe.
Assuming that the computer is not the only thing that exists in the parent universe, but there exist other things that can be in different states, we can assume that the entropy of the parent universe must be much larger than the entropy of our universe.
The simulation arguments states (from wikipedia):
"at least one of the following propositions is true:
- (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a posthuman stage;
- (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof);
- (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation."

I would argue that there is a 4th more likely option:
- (4) the combined number of thoughts by minds in all simulated universes is much smaller than the total number of thoughts by minds of the parent universe

Whether or not (4) is likely true depends on the assumption that electrons and protons and all that stuff actually exists and that our consciousness is a result of evolution.
If this is the case, then a computer in the parent universe must live in a universe many magnitudes more entropy, more different states, more stuff happening, and therefore the same order of magnitudes more chances for evolution or other processes to create structures that have a mind.
All I really know is that I am a mind and I am having the thought about whether or not I am living in a simulation.
But since I also assume that these thoughts occur much more often in the root universe, I believe I likely live in the root universe.
It doesn't really matter how many simulations there are - their combined computational power is much smaller than what would be needed to simulate the parent universe.
This argument would become invalid if we believe that the number of thoughts per entropy is much larger than in the parent universe - for example because the parent universe is made out of atoms and contains many details that are not necessary to produce thoughts, but our universe is a simulation of minds more directly, and all the other stuff we observe isn't actually real and only computed when we look.
At this point it becomes a bit hard not to make more assumptions about the parent universe - but if we imagine a human like civilization that would like to learn something by observing a simulation, then it seems completely unnecessary to include such details at all.
